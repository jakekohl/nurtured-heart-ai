        <h2>What is the Nurtured Heart Approach?</h2>
        <p>
          The Nurtured Heart Approach¬Æ (NHA) is a relationship-focused methodology that 
          transforms challenging behaviors by recognizing and celebrating success in the 
          present moment. It was developed by Howard Glasser to help children (and adults) 
          build inner wealth and self-regulation.

        <h2>How does this AI compliment generator work?</h2>
        <p>
          This tool uses an AI language model to generate personalized compliments based on 
          the information you provide: the recipient's name, your relationship, positive 
          qualities you've observed, and any specific context or achievements. The AI is 
          guided by prompts that ensure the compliments align with NHA principles.

        <h2>Is my data private and secure?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes! Your privacy is important. This application does not store any of the 
          information you enter or the compliments that are generated. Each session is 
          temporary, and no personal data is saved to databases or shared with third parties. 
          Once you close or refresh the page, all information is cleared.

        <h2>What AI model does this use?</h2>
        <p>
          This application uses a large language model specifically prompted to generate 
          compliments that align with the Nurtured Heart Approach principles. The AI is 
          designed to recognize and celebrate positive qualities, strengths, and achievements 
          in an authentic and meaningful way.

        <h2>Can I customize the compliments?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes! The generated compliments are meant to be starting points. You should always 
          adapt them to match your authentic voice and the specific nuances of your relationship. 
          The form allows you to specify qualities, context, tone, and relationship type to 
          help personalize the output.

        <h2>Is this affiliated with the official Nurtured Heart Approach organization?</h2>

        <h2>What if the generated compliments don't feel authentic?</h2>
        <p>
          AI-generated compliments are meant as inspiration and starting points, not final 
          products. The most important aspect of the Nurtured Heart Approach is authenticity. 
          Always review, modify, and personalize the compliments to match your genuine feelings 
          and natural communication style. If a generated compliment doesn't resonate, use it 
          as a template and adjust it to fit your authentic voice.

        <h2>Can I use this for professional/therapeutic purposes?</h2>
        <p>
          This tool can be helpful for professionals working with the Nurtured Heart Approach, 
          but it should be used thoughtfully. Consider it a support tool for brainstorming or 
          learning, not a replacement for professional judgment and authentic human connection. 
          Always prioritize your professional expertise and the unique needs of your clients.
